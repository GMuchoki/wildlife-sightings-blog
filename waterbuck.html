        <h2>About the Waterbuck</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong><a href="./waterbuck-hero.html">Waterbuck</a></strong> (<em>Kobus ellipsiprymnus</em>) is a large antelope commonly seen near rivers, lakes, or marshy areas across sub-Saharan Africa. Known for its shaggy coat and distinctive white ring around the rump, the waterbuck thrives in areas where water is nearby â€” not just for drinking, but because it uses wetlands as a safe refuge from predators.
        </p>
        <p>
            Waterbucks are grazers, feeding mainly on grasses, and are most active during cooler parts of the day. They live in herds, typically with females and young together, while mature males maintain territories during the breeding season.
