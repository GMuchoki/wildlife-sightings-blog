        <h2>About the Impala</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>impala</strong> (<em>Aepyceros melampus</em>) is one of Africa's most graceful and agile antelopes.
    Commonly found in savannas and light woodlands, impalas are highly social animals often seen in herds.
    Males are known for their impressive, spiraled horns, while females do not have horns at all.
        </p>
        <p>
            Impalas are <strong>incredibly fast and agile</strong>, capable of leaping over 10 feet high and covering
    distances of up to 30 feet in a single bound — a vital skill for escaping predators like leopards, lions, and wild dogs.
    Their diet consists mainly of grasses, fruits, and shrubs, making them both grazers and browsers depending on the season.

    <strong>Fun Fact:</strong> Impalas can switch between grazing and browsing depending on food availability —
    a handy survival trick during dry seasons!
